What is Power BI?
Power BI is a business analytics tool from Microsoft that helps you visualize data,
 create interactive reports and dashboards, and share insights across an organization 
 or with external stakeholders. It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, 
 transform raw data into meaningful insights, and make data-driven decisions.

Types of Visualizations in Power BI:
Cards: Display single values like Total Sales, Profit, etc.
Charts: Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc. for analyzing trends and comparisons.
Tables: Display detailed records.
Maps: For geospatial data to show data points on a map.
KPIs: Key Performance Indicators to track business metrics.

Steps to Create a Power BI Report:
Connect to Data: Import or connect to a data source.
Transform Data: Clean and shape the data using Power Query.
Create Relationships: Define relationships between tables in your dataset.
Build Visuals: Drag and drop fields into visualizations (charts, tables, etc.).
Publish: Share the reports to Power BI Service to collaborate and share insights.

Types of "Views" in Power BI:
Report View: Where you design and create the report with visuals.
Data View: A tabular view of your dataset.
Model View: Where you can define relationships between tables and manage the data model.
Dashboard View: In Power BI Service, where you can see multiple tiles summarizing different reports and metrics.
